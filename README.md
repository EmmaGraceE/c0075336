Hi, I'm @c0075336, the majority of the repositories here are notes and tutorials.

The Projects repository contains all of the full-scale work I've done - note that these were primarily for personal
enjoyment and may therefore not contain best practices, e.g., directly interacting with RMDBs rather than making use
of ORMs.

Most of my work is done in python and R due to my data science background. I've recently begun learning C++
though so is likely to start appearing.
